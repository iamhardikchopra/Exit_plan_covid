# Exit_Plan_Covid19
Effective and Efficient Algorithm for optimizing the order of vaccination of citizens .

### Covid-19 Pandemic 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  
Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses.

### Intervention:
1. Remove Week Ties ( Lockdown )
2. Speed up Vaccination

### Our Solution:
Entire World is suffering from a pandemic in some way, and now we are about to end this, as the vaccination is available for end user. Govt. have proposed different Phases for vaccination as per the profession but the entire process could become more effective if we define a set of parameters and then rank them.

#### Need?
New mutants of Covid-19 have been found and cases have started increasing now doses of vaccination per day is limited and its operating at its best so we should now focus on reaching the vaccine to the most need or most prone to virus first.
#### Optimize?
Currently only three parameters( AGe, Profession and Disease) are being taken into consideration. If the number of parameters rises it will be more optimized to deliver the vaccine to the needed one.
#### Where?
This Idea can be implemented in rural areas where the population is less than 1.5 lakhs and then later can be implemented to areas more dense and populated.
